NAME
    PPM::Make - Make a ppm package from a CPAN distribution

SYNOPSIS
      my $ppm = PPM::Make->new( [options] );
      $ppm->make_ppm();

DESCRIPTION
    See the supplied "make_ppm" script for a command-line interface.

    This module automates somewhat some of the steps needed to make a ppm
    (Perl Package Manager) package from a CPAN distribution. It attempts to
    fill in the ABSTRACT and AUTHOR attributes of Makefile.PL, if these
    are not supplied, and also uses pod2html to generate a set of html
    documentation. It also adjusts CODEBASE of package.ppd to reflect
    the generated package.tar.gz or package.zip archive, and can add
    a post-install script via the <INSTALL> field to the ppd file. 
    Such packages are suitable both for local installation via

      C:\.cpan\build\package_src> ppm install

    and for distribution via a repository.

    The module may be used either within a locally installed
    source distribution or else it can fetch and build remote
    distributions.

REQUIREMENTS
    As well as the needed software for unpacking and making .tar.gz and
    .zip archives, and a make program, it is assumed in this that
    CPAN.pm is available and already configured.

PPM PACKAGE
    A Win32 ppm package, suitable for use with ActivePerl
    compatible Perl packages (builds 6xx) is available at
      http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/
    To install, within the ppm shell set the repository to
      http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer
    and then
      ppm> install PPM-Make
