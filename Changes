Revision history for Perl extension PPM::Make.

0.87 Wed, Oct 4, 2006

  - remove PPM::XML::* files from distribution
  - add a skip option to PPM::Make to skip running the tests
  - when building up a list of dependencies, ignore those that
    come with ActivePerl
  - enable parse_ppd() to parse ppd files with multiple
    <IMPLEMENTATION> sections, and have PPM::Make::RepositorySummary
    output summary files with this information
  - add PPM::Make::Bundle to make a zipped bundle file containing
    a package and all of its prerequisites
  - fixes for setting the version number in certain edge cases
    (thanks to Serguei Trouchelle for the patch)
  - if fetch_file() fails on assuming the argument passed is a
    module, try it as a distribution.
  - split methods used in PPM::Make to obtain meta information
    about a distribution into PPM::Make::Meta
  - split functions used in PPM::Make to obtain config information
    into PPM::Make::Config
  - if the author meta information is an array ref, dereference it
    when writing the ppd file

0.83 Fri, Sep 1, 2006

  - use better cross-platform method to guess if a module
    is installed as a core module (reported by Jeff McCarrell)
  - introduce no_html option in PPM::Make (--no-html in make_ppm)
    to disable building of html docs, as some platforms (eg, linux)
    may not have an installhtmldir specified in Perl's Config
    (reported by Jeff McCarrell)
  - introduce --no-cfg as an alias to --no_cfg in make_ppm
  - allow zipped distributions made with the --zipdist option
    to be uploaded to a specified location, just as is done
    with the ppd and tar.gz files
  - in making up a ppd file, fetch either from the remote
    soap server or from CPAN.pm a list of modules for the
    given distribution, and use that to populate PROVIDE
    elements in the ppd file (introduced in ppm4). This can
    be disabled by using the no_pp,4 option in PPM::Make,
    or the --no-ppm4 switch in make_ppm
  - INCOMPATIBLE change: in PPM::Make, change the zip option
    to zip_archive, to enable creation of .zip archives,
    rather than .tar.gz ones.
  - Add PPM::Make::RepositorySummary to make ppm summary files
    (summary.ppm, searchsummary.ppm, package.lst, package.xml)
    for a repository, and add a rep_summary script as an interface

0.79 Mon, Aug 21, 2006
  - fix bug in xml_encode which led to replacing the '&'
    in entitities that were already encoded, such as '&lt;'.

0.78 Wed, Aug 2, 2006
  - drop requirement of PPM, and supply the needed files
    in the distribution, as the PPM distribution will install
    a ppm.bat which overwrites an existing (newer) ppm
    (reported by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - use HTML::Entities to encode fields in ppd file, so
    that high ASCII characters get encoded
    (reported by Serguei Trouchelle)
  - don't die if error results in loading META.yml file
  - rename html_escape routine of PPM::Make::Util to
    xml_encode, to better reflect purpose

0.76 Sat, Jan 8, 2006
  - add dependency on File::HomeDir to obtain $ENV{HOME}
  - allow argument to make_ppm accept a local file as the
    source of a distribution
  - add capability to make a ppm package for a Bundle/Task file,
    to install a list of prerequisites
  - fix loading of CPAN::Config to account for recent CPAN.pm changes
  - add dependency on PPM

0.75 Sat Sep 4 2004
  - adjust the routines for getting module and distribution
    information to accept an array reference of values, and
    return a corresponding hash reference. This cuts down
    particularly on repeated calls to the soap server for
    distributions with more than one prerequisite.
  - fix bug in calling dist_search/mod_search with wrong
    args in some cases when guessing author
  - fix parsing of YAML file in extracting AUTHOR field, if present

0.74 Fri Aug 27 2004
  - add Net::FTP debug messages (thanks to Jeff McCarrell)
  - honor presence of $ENV{HOME}, if present, on Win32
    in looking for the .ppmcfg configuration file (thanks to
    Jeff McCarrell)
  - fix bug where the AUTHOR was reported as an ARRAY ref
    in the ppd file when META.yaml was used
  - attempt to read Module::Build's information file
    only when the _build directory is present.
  - in getting author information, as well as module/distribution
    mappings, in filling out the ppd file, now first try a remote
    soap server, and if that fails, fall back to the CPAN indices.

0.71 Fri Apr 2 11:00:00 2004
  - fix bug in ppm_install for ppm3
  - use $^X rather than $Config{perlpath} for perl binary

0.70 Tue Mar 23 11:00:00 2004
  - fix warning in PPM::Make::Util when CPAN.pm is configured
    but doesn't have a url_list
  - added more checks in make_zipdist of PPM::Make when
    the codebase isn't a local file

0.69 Mon Mar 22 23:00:00 2004
  - use Archive::Zip::AZ_OK(), rather than AZ_OK().

    archive [thanks to Mike Schilli]

0.67 Thu Nov 20 20:08:00 2003
