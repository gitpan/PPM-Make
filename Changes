Revision history for Perl extension PPM::Make.

0.76 Sat, Jan 8, 2006
  - add dependency on File::HomeDir to obtain $ENV{HOME}
  - allow argument to make_ppm accept a local file as the
    source of a distribution
  - add capability to make a ppm package for a Bundle/Task file,
    to install a list of prerequisites
  - fix loading of CPAN::Config to account for recent CPAN.pm changes
  - add dependency on PPM

0.75 Sat Sep 4 2004
  - adjust the routines for getting module and distribution
    information to accept an array reference of values, and
    return a corresponding hash reference. This cuts down
    particularly on repeated calls to the soap server for
    distributions with more than one prerequisite.
  - fix bug in calling dist_search/mod_search with wrong
    args in some cases when guessing author
  - fix parsing of YAML file in extracting AUTHOR field, if present

0.74 Fri Aug 27 2004
  - add Net::FTP debug messages (thanks to Jeff McCarrell)
  - honor presence of $ENV{HOME}, if present, on Win32
    in looking for the .ppmcfg configuration file (thanks to
    Jeff McCarrell)
  - fix bug where the AUTHOR was reported as an ARRAY ref
    in the ppd file when META.yaml was used
  - attempt to read Module::Build's information file
    only when the _build directory is present.
  - in getting author information, as well as module/distribution
    mappings, in filling out the ppd file, now first try a remote
    soap server, and if that fails, fall back to the CPAN indices.

0.71 Fri Apr 2 11:00:00 2004
  - fix bug in ppm_install for ppm3
  - use $^X rather than $Config{perlpath} for perl binary

0.70 Tue Mar 23 11:00:00 2004
  - fix warning in PPM::Make::Util when CPAN.pm is configured
    but doesn't have a url_list
  - added more checks in make_zipdist of PPM::Make when
    the codebase isn't a local file

0.69 Mon Mar 22 23:00:00 2004
  - use Archive::Zip::AZ_OK(), rather than AZ_OK().

    ppd and archive files

    use on Win32 regarding which files to include in the
    archive [thanks to Mike Schilli]

0.67 Thu Nov 20 20:08:00 2003
